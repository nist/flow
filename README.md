# Flow

## What is Flow ?

Flow is a state of mind in which 100% of our attention is dedicated to something, to the point where we lost the awarness of space and time.

See the book [Flow](https://www.harpercollins.ca/9780061339202/flow/) of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi if you want to learn more about it.

## The goal

Keep track of time spent on a single task.

## The real goal

This project is a proof of concept of microservices in a monorepo, with continous integration and deployment in a container.
