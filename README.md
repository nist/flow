# Flow

## What is Flow ?

Flow is a state of mind in which 100% of our attention is dedicated to something, to the point where we lost the awarness of space and time.

See the book [Flow](https://www.harpercollins.ca/9780061339202/flow/) of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi if you want to learn more about it.

## The goal

Keep track of time spent on a single task.

## The real goal

This project is a proof of concept of microservices in a monorepo, with continous integration and deployment in a container.

## A tale of web development

- Is this hammer a good tool ?
- It depends. What it is for ?
- Build a house.
- Well, maybe for woodwork, but not for plumbing and electricity.
- But I like my hammer.
- You take the problem upside down. What kind of house do you want ? What is your needs ? You won't build the same house and use the same tools if you need a secure house versus a house open on the world.

Imagine now that you have to build a house on a world in constant change, inhabited with different kind of beings, with  their own culture and language. Some of them doesn't have the same physical characteristics than others. And this world is changing fast. And some lord try to control it. This world is internet. Our house must be able to withstand changes and evolve. Otherwise, it will sooner or later crumble.

The tools aren't the priority. The goals and the needs are more important. If we need to have a house ready as fast as possible, maybe a pre-built house is a good choice. If the house must move with the wind, it won't have walls, just provide what is needed.

In this world, we are better to be agile, master a toolbox, think carefully and measure twice before cutting !
